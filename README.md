# aiken-quizzer
The goal here is to create a tool that works similar to Anki, but accepts the Aiken format to create the quiz.

As of now, I'm defining "similar to Anki" with these requirements:
- multiple choice and short answer options. Ideally pictures at some point but I'd need a gui for that (only mcq supported now)
- repeating questions if the user wants to repeat it (right now its auto if they get the question wrong)

I love the logic of Anki, and wanted to use that same idea to try to make it easy to import a text file of questions and get that experience
